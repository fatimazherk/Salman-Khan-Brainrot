## Overview
Salman Khan Brainrot is a uniquely crafted love confession program, heavily infused with references to Bollywood's beloved Salman Khan. This playful yet heartfelt script progressively builds suspense using timed messages, ASCII art, and witty lines inspired by the actor’s iconic roles and songs. The program simulates a "loading" process, which, step by step, reveals a confession of love, combining humor, Bollywood charm, and a romantic gesture.

The core idea behind this project is to create an immersive, interactive experience by leveraging Salman Khan-related references as the medium for an emotional revelation. The program carefully uses delays to generate anticipation, leading to a grand finale featuring animated ASCII art.

## Features
- Progressive Love Confession:
The program simulates a loading sequence that humorously teases the final confession. At each 10% increment, a new Salman Khan reference is displayed.
- Timed Messages:
The Sleep() function is employed strategically to introduce delays between messages, enhancing the suspense as each stage of the confession is gradually revealed. The use of the system("cls") command ensures that the screen clears for each new message, maintaining a clean interface throughout the process.
- Bollywood References:
The program draws upon memorable quotes and scenes from Salman Khan’s famous movies, including dialogues from songs like “O O Jaane Jaana” and humorous nods to his filmography, creating an unmistakable Bollywood atmosphere.
- ASCII Art Animation:
The climax of the program features an ASCII art sequence that is triggered towards the end of the confession. This serves as both an artistic touch and a playful allusion to Salman Khan’s role in Indian cinema.
- User Engagement:
By creatively combining the technical structure of a C++ program with pop culture references, the script serves as both a tribute and an entertaining experience for fans of Salman Khan.

## How It Works
Loading Simulation: The main loop runs from 0 to 100, simulating the process of connecting to a "Love Server." At specific intervals (every 10%), a Bollywood-themed message is displayed.
Timed Delays: Using the Sleep() function, the program pauses between each phase, mimicking a real-time loading sequence. These delays enhance the interactive feel, creating an experience akin to waiting for an exciting surprise.
Clear Screen: With the system("cls") command, the program clears the console before printing each new message, ensuring a fresh and engaging display for each stage of the confession.
ASCII Animation: Toward the end of the script, a series of timed ASCII art frames are printed to the console, forming a rudimentary animation. This sequence serves as the visual climax of the program, pairing well with the final, romantic confession.

## Dependencies
The program is built in C++ and requires the Windows-specific windows.h library for the Sleep() function. It will only work on Windows systems due to the usage of system("cls") and Sleep().
Compiler: Any standard C++ compiler that supports the windows.h library (e.g., Visual Studio, Dev-C++).
Operating System: Windows.
